          My passion for technology was born when I was 5 years old, when I
          first used a computer.

          I started as a Front End Developer on 10/01/2020. Since then I have been
          dedicating about 4 hours a day to studies.

          I see that I am on the right path because I love helping people who
          are starting out, just as I was a beginner. Furthermore, I see the
          results that the dedicated hours bring.

          I have a huge passion for helping people who are just starting out and
          my biggest hobby is contributing to open source projects. Codes,
          movies, video games, music, podcast and studies are subjects that
          interest me.
